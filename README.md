# üíº Banking Transaction Management System - SQL Capstone Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a SQL-based capstone designed to simulate and manage the operations of a basic banking system. It uses structured datasets to manage customers, accounts, loans, branches, and transactions, allowing efficient querying and analysis using MySQL.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Design and implement a relational database for banking operations.
- Perform SQL queries to extract, analyze, and manage banking-related data.
- Understand and apply data handling and querying in real-world scenarios.
- Demonstrate ETL concepts by importing real datasets, cleaning, and querying them.

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Banks handle large volumes of data related to customers, branches, loans, accounts, and transactions. This project aims to build a simplified version of a banking database system that can store and manage this data efficiently and help generate useful insights through SQL queries.

## üí° Use Case

A **bank employee** or **admin** can use this system to:

- **Manage Customer and Account Details**: Add or retrieve customer and account information easily.
- **Track Loans**: Monitor loan records linked to specific customers and branches.
- **Record Transactions**: Store and analyze deposit, withdrawal, and transfer transactions.
- **Generate Reports**: Execute queries to summarize customer activity, balances, loan status, etc., for decision-making or auditing.

> This project simulates a **mini core banking system**, useful for training, analysis, or academic purposes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Database:** MySQL
- **Tools Used:** Excel, MySQL Workbench
- **Data Source:** Cleaned multi-sheet Excel dataset imported and converted into CSVs

---

## üîÑ ETL Process

- **Extract**: Dataset was obtained from Kaggle and included customer, account, branch, loan, and transaction information.
- **Transform**: The Excel files were reviewed for data quality. Columns with invalid symbols were cleaned (e.g., columns with only `######` were dropped or corrected).
- **Load**: The cleaned `.csv` files were imported into MySQL using `LOAD DATA INFILE` after creating appropriate relational tables.

## üìä Project Workflow

1. Created tables for:
   - `bank_customer_data`
   - `bank_account_data`
   - `bank_branch_data`
   - `bank_loan_data`
   - `bank_transaction_data`
2. Imported CSV data into each table.
3. Performed various queries (e.g., joins, group by, aggregation, subqueries).
4. Analyzed trends such as customer account activity, loan status, branch-wise transactions, and more.
5. Collected screenshots of outputs for presentation.
